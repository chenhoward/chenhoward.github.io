      <p>
        Hi, my name is Howard and I am a student and a creator.  I often develop
        Rails applications and have a fondness for cool client-side javascript
        applications.  Android development is something I do on the side.
        I'm really into music and I want to write some poetry one day.  These
        interests push me to try my hand at design because I like art and I want
        to make art.  Education and social welfare is my biggest areas of
        interests in terms of the social sector so talk with me about it!
