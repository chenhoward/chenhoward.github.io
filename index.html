    <p>
      I was a Project Leader for Cal Blueprint where I led a team of four other
      developers to build an Android application for the nonprofit Project
      Homeless Connect that would replace their current paper system.  This app
      provides the nonprofit with more security with confidential information
      and frees up volunteers to do more work at their events.
