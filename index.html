      <h2>Rails, Javascript, and Android Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Howard and I am a student and a creator.  I often develop
        Rails applications and have a fondness for cool client-side javascript
        applications.  Android development is something I do on the side.
        I'm really into music and I want to write some poetry one day.  These
        interests push me to try my hand at design because I like art and I want
        to make art.  Education and social welfare is my biggest areas of
        interests in terms of the social sector so talk with me about it!

  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <h3>Project Homeless Connect</h3>
    <p>
      I was a Project Leader for Cal Blueprint where I led a team of four other
      developers to build an Android application for the non-profit Project
      Homeless Connect that would replace their current paper system.  This app
      provides the non-profit with more security with confidential information
      and frees up volunteers to do more work at their events.
    </p>
  <h3>Rails Decal</h3>
    <p>
      I currently am the instructor for the Rails Decal, a course at UC Berkeley
      that teaches the Ruby on Rails framework to students.  I also was part of
      creating the website and currently maintain it.
    </p>
  <h3>Open Food Finder</h3>
    <p>
      Open Food Finder is an open source Android Application that allows users
      to post up food donations and claim them.  I mainly worked on creating the
      assets, layouts, views for User sessions, and integrating the Facebook SDK.
    </p>

    <p>
      Open Music Competition is an open source Rails Web App that students to
      sign up and pay for music competitions.  I created the account system,
