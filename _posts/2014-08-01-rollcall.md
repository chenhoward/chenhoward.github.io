### The First App

The first app I worked on during my time at Salesforce was [RollCall][rollcall-gh], an event management app that allows users to check-in and keep statistics on event attendees.  This app took my team the longest to build due to the fact that we were all full time students during the time, and it was our first time building a web app on the Salesforce platform.  This was also the first time I truely coded in Javascript.  Before my internship my experience in web development was limited to Ruby on Rails apps, which was great for CRUD operations, but not for learning Javascript.  At that point I had a very naive understanding of Javascript as Java except the only data type is a var.  It wasn’t until I was writing a bunch of javascript remoting calls to get and pass data from the server that I actually learned javascript.


### Using Libraries

At first we were doing a lot DOM manipulation  with vanilla javascript, which eventually led to writing bloated and hacky code.  This is where I was reminded of a very valuable lesson in coding.


Lesson Learned: Don’t reinvent the wheel.

If you are struggling with something, then somebody else probably has struggled with it before, and may have made a library that'll help you out.   There are plenty of javascript libraries out there that are just a Google search away.  At first I was not too fond of libraries because I wanted to learn more of the nitty-gritty javascript but after that phase and an enourmous amount of written code, we imported jQuery and never looked back.  Referencing and manipulating DOM elements became so easy, and it allowed us to integrate other libraries reliant on jQuery as well.

### Form Focus Issue

The biggest issue we encountered was in form input focus that occurs on Visualforce pages that are rendered through S1.  It seemed like every time we focus on a form input and then tapped or tried to scroll anywhere off the screen the keyboard stays up.

When you try typing on the keyboard afterwards no text appears even though it appears that the form element is focused.

  The workaround I found for this issue is pretty general (I think it can work for any kind of app), and it was to simply shift the focus to the whole window and then focus back on the original input element on every keyboard press.

  Here's the code snippet that requires [jQuery][jquery]: 

{% highlight javascript %}
window.onkeydown = function(e){
  var $focused = $(':focus');
  window.focus();
  $focused.focus();
}
{% endhighlight %}

So what is happening is that on the window we attach a function to the onkeydown (whenever you press a key on a keyboard) that will store the problematic focused input, then change the focus to the window, and finally return the focus back to the element.  After implementing this within S1 Visualforce pages the inputs should now allow you to type even after pressing the screen or scrolling.

The next app we worked on was [Inspector]({% post_url 2014-07-28-welcome-to-jekyll %}).
