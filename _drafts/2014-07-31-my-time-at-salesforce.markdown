So this is my first website/blog and I want to start it off with a series of post about my internship at [Salesforce][salesforce].  Just a whole mess of what I learned and such.  I have been an intern at Salesforce since February and it has been a great/awesometastic learning experience.  I remember when I first started my internship I was pretty scared of just being completely incompetent and failing everything that was expected of me.  I just feared that I would make a really bad impression during my first tech internship.

Lesson Learned: You aren’t expected to know everything right off the bat.

People understand it takes time to get spun up on the technologies you are using.  I’m pretty sure your manager wasn’t born knowing all the ins and outs of javascript (or whatever stack you are using), and he/she doesn’t expect you to either.  After all, the whole point of the internship for the intern is for it to be a learning experience.  This brings me to

Lesson Learned: Don't be afraid to ask questions.

Before I had the idea that I wanted to come off as if I knew what I was doing, but I realize it really speeds up your work if you simply ask questions.  You learn more, and maybe the person you are asking gains insight on the topic as well.  It also helps in showing whether or not you and the other people on your project are on the same page and have the same vision on whatever you are making.

What did I actually do at Salesforce though?  I wrote the javascript on the backend logic for mobile web apps that are run on Salesforce's S1 mobile app.  Our focus was apps for the enterprise use case while having them look like the stylish and modern consumer apps for the mobile phone.  This meant a focus on UX and UI and making sure our code ran as efficiently as possible on the less-resourced mobile phones.  Our first app was [RollCall]({% post_url 2014-07-28-welcome-to-jekyll %}).
