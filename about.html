<h1>More about</h1>

<h2>Me</h2>
<p>
  Currently I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at UC Berkeley.  I am an
  executive member in an organization called Blueprint, which builds technology
  for nonprofit organizations.  The skill I developed the most as both a
  developer and a Project Leader for Blueprint was Ruby on Rails.  I now am the
  instructor for a Ruby on Rails class at UC Berkeley.

<h2>This Site</h2>
<p>
  I created this site in order to improve my HTML and CSS skills by trying to
  build it without any front-end frameworks.  The only thing I used that already
  written was normalize.css.  I also wanted a blogging platform where I could
  talk about my developer experience.
