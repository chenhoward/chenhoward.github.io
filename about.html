  Currently I am a 4th year Computer Science student at UC Berkeley.  I am an
  executive member in an organization called Blueprint, which builds technology
  for nonprofit organizations.  The skill I developed the most as both a
  developer and a Project Leader for Blueprint was Ruby on Rails.  I now am the
  instructor for a Ruby on Rails class at UC Berkeley.  I have also worked on two Android
  applications while working with Blueprint.

  I have previous work experience at both Salesforce and Groupon.  At Groupon I worked on it's
  Breadcrumb team as a Rails Engineer, creating endpoints for the external API and tables for new
  features.  I also optimized endpoints by using Rails to generate query strings and running the
  query without creating instances of ActiveModel but rather rendering the data immediate as a JSON
  string.  I also created features for Restaurants to aggregate their data by their individual
  servers by writing clientside javascript using Backbone.  I also wrote a node script that
  generated CSV data for the restaurant.  This node script was used by an asynchronous worker I
  made that fired at the end a of a restaurants day.   At Salesforce I wrote javascript applications
  using Angular and d3.js that received data from endpoints I wrote ontop of the Salesforce platform.
  I primarily focused on efficient code to run on top of mobile platforms.

  I created this site in order to improve my HTML and CSS skills by trying to
  build it without any front-end frameworks.  The only thing I used that already
  written was normalize.css.  I also wanted a blogging platform where I could
  talk about my developer experience.

  In the near future I plan to get into more design work and get better at using illustrator as a
  tool.  I also want to get into iOS development as well using Swift!
